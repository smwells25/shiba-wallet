# Project State — Mobile AA Wallet ("Shiba Wallet", working title)

This file is the persistent state for all agents working on this project.
Read it fully before doing any work. Update it after every completed task.

## Project objective

A non-custodial mobile cryptocurrency wallet whose defining feature is
**Account Abstraction (ERC-4337 / EIP-7702)** on EVM chains, with first-class
support for Bitcoin, Solana, Dogecoin, and an extensible adapter system
capable of supporting thousands of other assets.

Non-negotiable requirements (from the Lead Chairperson):

1. **Non-custodial.** Keys are generated, stored, and used only on the user's
   device. No server ever sees key material. Fundamental; never compromise.
2. **Recovery and backup are required.** Implemented as a hierarchical
   deterministic (HD) wallet: a single BIP-39 seed phrase derives a BIP-32
   master key; each asset uses hardened derivation paths (BIP-44 / SLIP-44).
3. **Account Abstraction is the key differentiator.** Smart accounts,
   gas sponsorship (paymasters), batched transactions, session keys, social
   recovery on-chain, passkey signers.
4. **Maximum flexibility.** No architectural lock-in; every feature must be
   addable later without rewrites. Chain support is pluggable (adapter
   pattern). Staking is optional but valuable where it intersects AA.
5. Deliverable for the Chairperson: a complete feature-universe analysis so
   leadership can choose where to invest.
6. **Token and NFT support is required** (added by the Chairperson
   2026-09-27): ERC-20 fungible tokens (e.g. USDC) and NFTs (ERC-721,
   ERC-1155), designed so ANY fungible or non-fungible asset class can be
   supported later (SPL tokens, Token-2022, Ordinals/Runes, ...). Assets are
   identified by CAIP-19 ids in core so token support is chain-agnostic.

## Toolchain

- Node.js: v24.21.0 via nvm (Chairperson's directive: keep Node current).
  Shell default may still resolve to v14, so always prefix PATH:
  `export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH"`
- Language: TypeScript. Monorepo with npm workspaces.
- Crypto primitives: `@scure/bip32`, `@scure/bip39`, `@noble/curves`,
  `@noble/hashes` (audited, dependency-free). Never hand-roll primitives.
- Tests: vitest, validated against official BIP-32/39/44 test vectors.
- Mobile shell: React Native (planned; core library is UI-agnostic on purpose).

      JSON persistence; ERC-20/721/1155 + SPL representable)
- [x] docs/ARCHITECTURE.md — landed and CTO-reviewed (fixed Solana account
      indexing: third segment increments per Phantom's documented
      m/44'/501'/{index}'/0' convention; ADRs D1–D7 live in its section 7,
      which supersedes the planned separate DECISIONS.md)

- [x] Chain adapter interface + ChainRegistry (CAIP-2 keyed)
- [x] Core key providers: EVM, Bitcoin (BIP-84), Dogecoin, Solana — offline
      key/address half; network adapters still to come below
- [x] EVM ERC-4337 adapter (@shiba-wallet/chains-evm): EntryPoint v0.7
      UserOperation packing + userOpHash (verified vs account-abstraction
      v0.7.0 sources, cross-checked vs ethers AbiCoder), CREATE2
      counterfactual addresses (vs ethers.getCreate2Address), vendor-neutral
      BundlerClient + ERC-7677 PaymasterClient over injected transports,
      SmartAccountClient orchestration (stub → estimate → final paymaster →
      sign → send), SimpleAccount spec (EIP-191 owner sigs, execute /
      executeBatch ABI byte-identical to ethers), minimal ABI encoder.
      25 tests
- [x] Feature Universe published as a shareable page for the Chairperson:
      https://claude.ai/artifact/JEfyMuPcMJ8YW5x3ZKitsw (private until
      shared; regenerate from docs/FEATURE_UNIVERSE.md if it changes).
      Doc fix applied: features 10–11 assigned to Tier 2, Tier 2 list
      corrected from "85–87" to "85, 87" (86 is Tier 3)
- [x] Bitcoin/Dogecoin network adapter — packages/chains-utxo
      (@shiba-wallet/chains-utxo): raw tx build/sign offline-pure (P2WPKH
      BIP-143 for Bitcoin, legacy P2PKH sighash for Dogecoin, DER low-S
      SIGHASH_ALL), greedy largest-first coin selection with sat/vB fees and
      dust handling (546/294 sat, verified from Bitcoin Core policy.cpp),
      address decode/encode (bech32 v0 + base58check; taproot rejected
      clearly), injected Esplora-style transport (getUtxos/broadcastTx).
      40 tests: signed txs byte-identical to bitcoinjs-lib for both chains;
      Dogecoin prefixes 0x1e/0x16/0x9e verified from chainparams.cpp
- [x] Solana network adapter (@shiba-wallet/chains-solana): legacy message
      compile/serialize (compact-u16, header, account ordering), System
      Program transfer, ed25519 signing, vendor-neutral RPC client
      (getLatestBlockhash/getBalance/sendTransaction/getSignatureStatuses
      polling); 27 tests, message bytes and signatures byte-identical to
      @solana/web3.js 1.99.0
- [x] Test suite w/ official vectors (SLIP-0010 both vectors, BIP-84
      addresses; EVM cross-checked vs ethers.js, Solana vs ed25519-hd-key;
      Dogecoin version byte 0x1e verified from dogecoin/dogecoin
      chainparams.cpp) — 22 tests passing
- [x] React Native app shell — app/ (Expo SDK 57, TypeScript, React
      Navigation native stack). Deliberately NOT a workspace member:
      consumes @shiba-wallet/core via a file: dependency (npm symlink) plus
      metro.config.js watchFolders/nodeModulesPaths (see app/README.md).
      Screens: onboarding (generate mnemonic via core + backup warning +
      2-word quiz, or import with validation), Home (account-0 addresses for
      ETH/BTC/DOGE/SOL derived through core providers), Receive (full
      address + copy), Settings (gated seed reveal, double-confirm wipe).
      Mnemonic lives only in expo-secure-store
      (WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY); crypto.getRandomValues polyfilled
      from expo-crypto in app/src/polyfills.ts (first import). Verified:
      tsc --noEmit clean; npx expo export --platform android bundles
      884 modules with engine code confirmed inside the Hermes bundle
- [x] Send flow in the app (phase 2, task 2) + biometric gating (task 7):
      app/src/wallet/send.ts (pure engine glue: recipient validation via
      engine code — EIP-55 through core toChecksumAddress, UTXO through
      addressToScriptPubKey, SOL base58→32 bytes; fee quotes — EVM
      suggestFees+estimateGas with endpoint chain-id verification, BTC/DOGE
      Esplora GET /fee-estimates verified against the Esplora API docs, SOL
      getFeeForMessage verified against solana.com/docs/rpc with a flagged
      5000-lamports-per-signature fallback; max-amount helpers; EOA
      sign+broadcast with a marked SmartAccountClient seam), parseUnits in
      balances.ts (exact bigint, tested in app/scripts/test-units.mjs — 45
      cases incl. EIP-55 vectors and taproot rejection), SendScreen
      (form→confirm→success in one screen, "Mainnet — real funds" badge,
      eth_call pre-flight blocks the EVM send unless explicitly overridden,
      dust + insufficient-funds errors in plain language, explorer links
      etherscan.io/blockstream.info/solscan.io, DOGE validates but shows
      "sending unavailable" without an endpoint), expo-local-authentication
      gating both the Settings seed reveal and the final send confirm (only
      when hardware+enrollment exist; disableDeviceFallback:false so the OS
      passcode fallback works; matrix in app/src/wallet/biometric.ts).
      Verified: tsc --noEmit clean; expo export --platform android bundles
      with the new strings confirmed inside the Hermes bytecode. No real
      transaction was broadcast.

## Key decisions (ADRs D1–D7 live in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md section 7)

- D1: Single BIP-39 mnemonic is the root of all assets, including the ERC-4337
  smart-account owner key. Smart accounts are counterfactual contracts whose
  owner EOA key derives from the seed, so one seed phrase recovers everything.
- D2: Core library is pure TypeScript, no React/native deps, so the same code
  serves mobile, extension, or CLI later (flexibility requirement).
- D3: Chain support via a `ChainAdapter` interface + registry keyed by
  SLIP-44 coin type / CAIP-2 chain id, so thousands of chains can register
  without touching core.

## Known blockers

- None currently. Network access for npm assumed; verify on first install.

## Phase 1 complete (2026-09-27)

Engine (4 packages, 120 tests, every cryptographic path validated against
official vectors or an independent implementation), leadership docs
(FEATURE_UNIVERSE.md published as a shareable page for the Chairperson:
https://claude.ai/artifact/JEfyMuPcMJ8YW5x3ZKitsw, plus ARCHITECTURE.md
with ADRs D1–D7), offline end-to-end demo (examples/demo.mjs, run with
`node examples/demo.mjs` after `npm run build`), and the Expo app shell.

## Phase 2 progress

- [x] SPL token transfers in chains-solana (phase 2 task 5): PDA derivation
      (sha256(seeds || bump || programId || "ProgramDerivedAddress"), bump
      255 down to 1, off-curve check via noble ed25519 — algorithm verified
      against web3.js 1.99.0 createProgramAddressSync/findProgramAddressSync
      source), ATA derivation ([owner, tokenProgram, mint] under
      ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL, seed order verified from
      solana-program/associated-token-account interface sources),
      TransferChecked (tag 12 + u64 LE amount + u8 decimals, account order
      from solana-program/token instruction.rs), idempotent create-ATA
      (discriminant 1), buildSplTransfer composer with optional recipient
      ATA creation. 17 new tests (44 total in the package): ATA addresses
      equal spl-token getAssociatedTokenAddressSync incl. an off-curve PDA
      owner; full transfer transactions byte-identical (message bytes,
      signatures, wire) to web3.js + @solana/spl-token 0.4.15, with and
      without the create-ATA instruction

## Phase 2 scorecard (2026-09-27)

- [x] Task 1 — live native balances on Home (see checked entry above).
      Remaining slice: ERC-20 balance display (decoders exist in
      chains-evm; needs a token-list UI using core's AssetRegistry).
- [x] Task 2 — send flow for all four chains (app/src/wallet/send.ts,
      SendScreen with form/confirm/success, per-chain validation through
      engine code, exact bigint parseUnits, fee quotes verified against
      Esplora and Solana RPC docs, EVM pre-flight simulation with decoded
      revert reasons, max buttons, mainnet warning badge). EVM sends take
      the EOA path; the SmartAccountClient seam in send.ts is marked and
      waits on a bundler endpoint (task 3 vendor config).
- [x] Task 3 — AA stack selection recorded in docs/AA_STACK.md (EntryPoint
      v0.7 pinned; SimpleAccount for testnet, ERC-7579 modular account as
      production target; factory addresses are per-chain config with a
      mandatory on-chain verification procedure; bundler/paymaster vendor
      criteria set). Vendor endpoints themselves are still unconfigured.
- [x] Task 4 — EIP-1559 EOA transactions in chains-evm (RLP encoder,
      type-2 signing byte-identical with ethers.js, NodeClient with fee
      suggestion/nonce/broadcast). 46 tests in chains-evm.
- [x] Task 5 — SPL token transfers in chains-solana (see checked entry
      above). 44 tests in chains-solana.
- [~] Task 6 — first slice done: eth_call pre-flight with revert decoding
      (Error(string), Panic codes, custom errors) in chains-evm, used by
      the app's send flow. Full asset-diff simulation remains.
- [x] Task 7 — biometric gating (expo-local-authentication) on the seed
      reveal and send confirmation, passcode fallback enabled; matrix in
      app/src/wallet/biometric.ts. Note: FaceID needs a dev build, not
      Expo Go.
- [ ] Task 8 — testnet smoke test: harness ready (scripts/testnet/
      setup.mjs + smoke.mjs, endpoints verified, dev wallet generated,
      dry-run clean). BLOCKED on faucet funds from the Chairperson
      (addresses printed by setup.mjs) and, for the ERC-4337 leg, a
      bundler API key. Dogecoin testnet additionally lacks any public
      Esplora-compatible API (infrastructure blocker, skippable).

## Next recommended tasks (phase 3 candidates)

1. Run the testnet smoke once funds land; then the ERC-4337 smoke against
   a real bundler (needs API key), including counterfactual deployment of
   a SimpleAccount on Sepolia per docs/AA_STACK.md verification steps.
2. ERC-20 balance display + token management UI (AssetRegistry-backed).
3. Wire the smart-account send path in the app behind a feature flag.
4. Full simulation (asset diffs) and approval-revocation groundwork.
5. WalletConnect v2 integration (Tier 1 feature 78).
6. Activity/history screen (Tier 1 feature 90, engine-side tx decoding).
