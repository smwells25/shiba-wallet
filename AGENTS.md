# Project State — Mobile AA Wallet ("Shiba Wallet", working title)

This file is the persistent state for all agents working on this project.
Read it fully before doing any work. Update it after every completed task.

## Project objective

A non-custodial mobile cryptocurrency wallet whose defining feature is
**Account Abstraction (ERC-4337 / EIP-7702)** on EVM chains, with first-class
support for Bitcoin, Solana, Dogecoin, and an extensible adapter system
capable of supporting thousands of other assets.

Non-negotiable requirements (from the Lead Chairperson):

1. **Non-custodial.** Keys are generated, stored, and used only on the user's
   device. No server ever sees key material. Fundamental; never compromise.
2. **Recovery and backup are required.** Implemented as a hierarchical
   deterministic (HD) wallet: a single BIP-39 seed phrase derives a BIP-32
   master key; each asset uses hardened derivation paths (BIP-44 / SLIP-44).
3. **Account Abstraction is the key differentiator.** Smart accounts,
   gas sponsorship (paymasters), batched transactions, session keys, social
   recovery on-chain, passkey signers.
4. **Maximum flexibility.** No architectural lock-in; every feature must be
   addable later without rewrites. Chain support is pluggable (adapter
   pattern). Staking is optional but valuable where it intersects AA.
5. Deliverable for the Chairperson: a complete feature-universe analysis so
   leadership can choose where to invest.
6. **Token and NFT support is required** (added by the Chairperson
   2026-09-27): ERC-20 fungible tokens (e.g. USDC) and NFTs (ERC-721,
   ERC-1155), designed so ANY fungible or non-fungible asset class can be
   supported later (SPL tokens, Token-2022, Ordinals/Runes, ...). Assets are
   identified by CAIP-19 ids in core so token support is chain-agnostic.

## Toolchain

- Node.js: v24.21.0 via nvm (Chairperson's directive: keep Node current).
  Shell default may still resolve to v14, so always prefix PATH:
  `export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH"`
- Language: TypeScript. Monorepo with npm workspaces.
- Crypto primitives: `@scure/bip32`, `@scure/bip39`, `@noble/curves`,
  `@noble/hashes` (audited, dependency-free). Never hand-roll primitives.
- Tests: vitest, validated against official BIP-32/39/44 test vectors.
- Mobile shell: React Native (planned; core library is UI-agnostic on purpose).

## Status

- [x] Repo initialized (git, main branch)
- [x] Toolchain verified (Node 24.21.0 via nvm)
- [x] docs/FEATURE_UNIVERSE.md — landed (99 features, 12 categories, tiered
      strategy); pending CTO review
- [ ] Asset/token layer in core (CAIP-19 asset types, token registry) — new
      requirement, queued after keyring tests
- [x] docs/ARCHITECTURE.md — landed (system layers, key management, AA design,
      chain adapters, threat model, flexibility, ADRs D1–D7); pending review
- [ ] packages/core keyring (BIP-39/32/44, hardened paths) — in progress (CTO)
- [ ] Chain adapter interface + registry
- [ ] EVM + ERC-4337 adapter
- [ ] Bitcoin/Dogecoin adapter
- [ ] Solana adapter
- [ ] Test suite w/ official BIP vectors
- [ ] React Native app shell

## Key decisions (rationale in docs/DECISIONS.md as they land)

- D1: Single BIP-39 mnemonic is the root of all assets, including the ERC-4337
  smart-account owner key. Smart accounts are counterfactual contracts whose
  owner EOA key derives from the seed, so one seed phrase recovers everything.
- D2: Core library is pure TypeScript, no React/native deps, so the same code
  serves mobile, extension, or CLI later (flexibility requirement).
- D3: Chain support via a `ChainAdapter` interface + registry keyed by
  SLIP-44 coin type / CAIP-2 chain id, so thousands of chains can register
  without touching core.

## Known blockers

- None currently. Network access for npm assumed; verify on first install.

## Next recommended tasks

1. Finish core keyring + tests.
2. Review and land the two delegated docs.
3. EVM/ERC-4337 adapter with UserOperation building.
4. UTXO adapter (BTC/DOGE), Solana adapter.
5. Signing/tx-flow integration tests, then app shell.
