# Project State — Mobile AA Wallet ("Shiba Wallet", working title)

This file is the persistent state for all agents working on this project.
Read it fully before doing any work. Update it after every completed task.

## Project objective

A non-custodial mobile cryptocurrency wallet whose defining feature is
**Account Abstraction (ERC-4337 / EIP-7702)** on EVM chains, with first-class
support for Bitcoin, Solana, Dogecoin, and an extensible adapter system
capable of supporting thousands of other assets.

Non-negotiable requirements (from the Lead Chairperson):

1. **Non-custodial.** Keys are generated, stored, and used only on the user's
   device. No server ever sees key material. Fundamental; never compromise.
2. **Recovery and backup are required.** Implemented as a hierarchical
   deterministic (HD) wallet: a single BIP-39 seed phrase derives a BIP-32
   master key; each asset uses hardened derivation paths (BIP-44 / SLIP-44).
3. **Account Abstraction is the key differentiator.** Smart accounts,
   gas sponsorship (paymasters), batched transactions, session keys, social
   recovery on-chain, passkey signers.
4. **Maximum flexibility.** No architectural lock-in; every feature must be
   addable later without rewrites. Chain support is pluggable (adapter
   pattern). Staking is optional but valuable where it intersects AA.
5. Deliverable for the Chairperson: a complete feature-universe analysis so
   leadership can choose where to invest.
6. **Token and NFT support is required** (added by the Chairperson
   2026-09-27): ERC-20 fungible tokens (e.g. USDC) and NFTs (ERC-721,
   ERC-1155), designed so ANY fungible or non-fungible asset class can be
   supported later (SPL tokens, Token-2022, Ordinals/Runes, ...). Assets are
   identified by CAIP-19 ids in core so token support is chain-agnostic.

## Toolchain

- Node.js: v24.21.0 via nvm (Chairperson's directive: keep Node current).
  Shell default may still resolve to v14, so always prefix PATH:
  `export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin:$PATH"`
- Language: TypeScript. Monorepo with npm workspaces.
- Crypto primitives: `@scure/bip32`, `@scure/bip39`, `@noble/curves`,
  `@noble/hashes` (audited, dependency-free). Never hand-roll primitives.
- Tests: vitest, validated against official BIP-32/39/44 test vectors.
- Mobile shell: React Native (planned; core library is UI-agnostic on purpose).

      JSON persistence; ERC-20/721/1155 + SPL representable)
- [x] docs/ARCHITECTURE.md — landed and CTO-reviewed (fixed Solana account
      indexing: third segment increments per Phantom's documented
      m/44'/501'/{index}'/0' convention; ADRs D1–D7 live in its section 7,
      which supersedes the planned separate DECISIONS.md)

- [x] Chain adapter interface + ChainRegistry (CAIP-2 keyed)
- [x] Core key providers: EVM, Bitcoin (BIP-84), Dogecoin, Solana — offline
      key/address half; network adapters still to come below
- [x] EVM ERC-4337 adapter (@shiba-wallet/chains-evm): EntryPoint v0.7
      UserOperation packing + userOpHash (verified vs account-abstraction
      v0.7.0 sources, cross-checked vs ethers AbiCoder), CREATE2
      counterfactual addresses (vs ethers.getCreate2Address), vendor-neutral
      BundlerClient + ERC-7677 PaymasterClient over injected transports,
      SmartAccountClient orchestration (stub → estimate → final paymaster →
      sign → send), SimpleAccount spec (EIP-191 owner sigs, execute /
      executeBatch ABI byte-identical to ethers), minimal ABI encoder.
      25 tests
- [x] Feature Universe published as a shareable page for the Chairperson:
      https://claude.ai/artifact/JEfyMuPcMJ8YW5x3ZKitsw (private until
      shared; regenerate from docs/FEATURE_UNIVERSE.md if it changes).
      Doc fix applied: features 10–11 assigned to Tier 2, Tier 2 list
      corrected from "85–87" to "85, 87" (86 is Tier 3)
- [x] Bitcoin/Dogecoin network adapter — packages/chains-utxo
      (@shiba-wallet/chains-utxo): raw tx build/sign offline-pure (P2WPKH
      BIP-143 for Bitcoin, legacy P2PKH sighash for Dogecoin, DER low-S
      SIGHASH_ALL), greedy largest-first coin selection with sat/vB fees and
      dust handling (546/294 sat, verified from Bitcoin Core policy.cpp),
      address decode/encode (bech32 v0 + base58check; taproot rejected
      clearly), injected Esplora-style transport (getUtxos/broadcastTx).
      40 tests: signed txs byte-identical to bitcoinjs-lib for both chains;
      Dogecoin prefixes 0x1e/0x16/0x9e verified from chainparams.cpp
- [x] Solana network adapter (@shiba-wallet/chains-solana): legacy message
      compile/serialize (compact-u16, header, account ordering), System
      Program transfer, ed25519 signing, vendor-neutral RPC client
      (getLatestBlockhash/getBalance/sendTransaction/getSignatureStatuses
      polling); 27 tests, message bytes and signatures byte-identical to
      @solana/web3.js 1.99.0
- [x] Test suite w/ official vectors (SLIP-0010 both vectors, BIP-84
      addresses; EVM cross-checked vs ethers.js, Solana vs ed25519-hd-key;
      Dogecoin version byte 0x1e verified from dogecoin/dogecoin
      chainparams.cpp) — 22 tests passing
- [x] React Native app shell — app/ (Expo SDK 57, TypeScript, React
      Navigation native stack). Deliberately NOT a workspace member:
      consumes @shiba-wallet/core via a file: dependency (npm symlink) plus
      metro.config.js watchFolders/nodeModulesPaths (see app/README.md).
      Screens: onboarding (generate mnemonic via core + backup warning +
      2-word quiz, or import with validation), Home (account-0 addresses for
      ETH/BTC/DOGE/SOL derived through core providers), Receive (full
      address + copy), Settings (gated seed reveal, double-confirm wipe).
      Mnemonic lives only in expo-secure-store
      (WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY); crypto.getRandomValues polyfilled
      from expo-crypto in app/src/polyfills.ts (first import). Verified:
      tsc --noEmit clean; npx expo export --platform android bundles
      884 modules with engine code confirmed inside the Hermes bundle

## Key decisions (ADRs D1–D7 live in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md section 7)

- D1: Single BIP-39 mnemonic is the root of all assets, including the ERC-4337
  smart-account owner key. Smart accounts are counterfactual contracts whose
  owner EOA key derives from the seed, so one seed phrase recovers everything.
- D2: Core library is pure TypeScript, no React/native deps, so the same code
  serves mobile, extension, or CLI later (flexibility requirement).
- D3: Chain support via a `ChainAdapter` interface + registry keyed by
  SLIP-44 coin type / CAIP-2 chain id, so thousands of chains can register
  without touching core.

## Known blockers

- None currently. Network access for npm assumed; verify on first install.

## Phase 1 complete (2026-09-27)

Engine (4 packages, 120 tests, every cryptographic path validated against
official vectors or an independent implementation), leadership docs
(FEATURE_UNIVERSE.md published as a shareable page for the Chairperson:
https://claude.ai/artifact/JEfyMuPcMJ8YW5x3ZKitsw, plus ARCHITECTURE.md
with ADRs D1–D7), offline end-to-end demo (examples/demo.mjs, run with
`node examples/demo.mjs` after `npm run build`), and the Expo app shell.

## Phase 2 progress

- [x] SPL token transfers in chains-solana (phase 2 task 5): PDA derivation
      (sha256(seeds || bump || programId || "ProgramDerivedAddress"), bump
      255 down to 1, off-curve check via noble ed25519 — algorithm verified
      against web3.js 1.99.0 createProgramAddressSync/findProgramAddressSync
      source), ATA derivation ([owner, tokenProgram, mint] under
      ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL, seed order verified from
      solana-program/associated-token-account interface sources),
      TransferChecked (tag 12 + u64 LE amount + u8 decimals, account order
      from solana-program/token instruction.rs), idempotent create-ATA
      (discriminant 1), buildSplTransfer composer with optional recipient
      ATA creation. 17 new tests (44 total in the package): ATA addresses
      equal spl-token getAssociatedTokenAddressSync incl. an off-curve PDA
      owner; full transfer transactions byte-identical (message bytes,
      signatures, wire) to web3.js + @solana/spl-token 0.4.15, with and
      without the create-ATA instruction

## Next recommended tasks (phase 2)

- [x] (task 1, 2026-09-27) Live native balances on Home: app/src/config/
      (verified public defaults — Ethereum ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com,
      Bitcoin blockstream.info/api, Solana api.mainnet-beta.solana.com;
      Dogecoin has no verified public Esplora-compatible API so it defaults
      to a clean "unavailable" state — plus AsyncStorage user overrides),
      app/src/wallet/balances.ts (thin calls into chains-evm httpTransport
      eth_getBalance, chains-utxo esploraTransport getUtxos sum, and
      chains-solana SolanaRpcClient.getBalance; one retry), per-row
      loading/error/retry + pull-to-refresh on Home, endpoint edit/reset in
      Settings. chains-evm/utxo/solana added to the app as file: deps with
      an npm overrides entry for @shiba-wallet/core (see app/README.md).
      Verified: tsc --noEmit clean, expo export bundles with engine RPC
      code inside, app/scripts/check-balances.mjs answers live against the
      defaults. ERC-20 balances not yet wired (native coins only this
      pass).

1. Wire the app's Home screen to live balances: EVM eth_getBalance +
   ERC-20 balanceOf via chains-evm decoders, Esplora getUtxos via
   chains-utxo, Solana getBalance via chains-solana (needs RPC endpoint
   configuration UX and sensible public defaults). — DONE for native
   balances (see checked item above); ERC-20 display remains.
2. Send flow in the app: amount entry, fee display, engine tx build/sign,
   broadcast through the injected transports; EVM sends should offer the
   smart-account path (SmartAccountClient) once a bundler endpoint is
   configured.
3. Pick and pin the ERC-4337 stack for launch chains: bundler/paymaster
   vendor config (they are already injectable), the account implementation
   to ship (SimpleAccount vs an ERC-7579 modular account per ADR D6), and
   the factory addresses per chain (verify against live deployments).
4. EIP-1559 EOA transaction building/signing in chains-evm (RLP, type-2)
   for plain sends without a bundler dependency.
5. ~~SPL token transfers in chains-solana (associated token accounts).~~
   Done; see Phase 2 progress above.
6. Transaction simulation + human-readable preview (Tier 1 feature 49).
7. Biometric gating of secure-store reads in the app (expo-local-auth).
8. Testnet smoke test end-to-end: fund the test wallet on a testnet and
   broadcast one real transaction per chain family.
